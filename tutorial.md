# first step

Creation of the ts template with react native and expo go

```js
npx create-expo-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript
```

# second step

Organization of directories into:

src/
    /assets
    /components
    /routes
    /screens
    /storage
    /theme
    /utils

# third step
module installation for alias

babel-plugin-module-resolver

where we can call, for example, @assets instead of src/assets
